Is it\n            really? There are fundamental changes in thought processes which are\n            often neglected, leading to poor schema design. This talk presents a\n            structured approach to thinking in GraphQL and designing user\n            centric schemas. The primary goal of the talk is to present a\n            structured approach to thinking in GraphQL with something I like to\n            call \"Activities To Be Done (ATBDs)\". I highlight a stepwise process\n            to design a truly \"graph-based\" schema. We will also see how this\n            approach helps various personas and facilitates in identifying\n            \"control points\" for a schema.\n          </p>\n\n          <iframe\n            width=\"560\"\n            height=\"315\"\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntgMQxFi0KQ\"\n            title=\"YouTube video player\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n            allowfullscreen\n          ></iframe>\n\n          <table>\n            <tbody>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Conference</td>\n                <td>GraphQL Asia 2020</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Date</td>\n                <td>Feb 20, 2020</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Slides</td>\n                <td>\n                  <a\n                    href=\"https://github.com/ankit-m/talks/tree/master/reactfoo-2018\"\n                    target=\"_blank\"\n                    rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n                  >\n                    https://github.com/ankit-m/talks/tree/master/reactfoo-2018\n                  </a>\n                </td>\n              </tr>\n            </tbody>\n          </table>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"secure-bff\">\n          <h4>Building a secure Backend For Frontend</h4>\n          <p>\n            Introduce audience to security implications while writing\n            application code for public facing gateway services.

But what is VDOM? How does it make React fast?\n            How does it optimize changes? Why do I need to use setState? This\n            talk aims to answer such questions about the internal workings of\n            React. Following topics are covered -\n            <ol>\n              <li>\n                React Philosophy: Understanding the core principles can help us\n                understand why certain decisions were taken and what are the\n                best use cases for React\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Internal structure: High level overview of internal react\n                modules and their function. This provides a mental map of where\n                things fit in.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Stack Reconciler: Understanding the old reconciliation process,\n                its implementation and limitations.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Fiber Reconciler: Deep dive into the implementation and\n                benefits. Understanding the underlying computer science problems\n                in both reconcilers.\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n            The aim is not to teach how React is implemented but to give the\n            audience a peek into internal workings of React which will help them\n            write better code, which takes advantage of the same. It will also\n            help them understand the reasons behind common dos and don'ts.\n            Lastly, it would help audience appreciate the simplicity of the\n            solution to a complex UI problem.\n          </p>\n\n          <table>\n            <tbody>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Conference</td>\n                <td>ReactFoo 2018</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Date</td>\n                <td>Aug 18, 2018</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>Slides</td>\n                <td>\n                  <a\n                    href=\"https://github.com/ankit-m/talks/tree/master/reactfoo-2018\"\n                    target=\"_blank\"\n                    rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n                  >\n                    https://github.com/ankit-m/talks/tree/master/reactfoo-2018\n                  </a>\n                </td>\n              </tr>\n            </tbody>\n          </table>\n        </section>\n      </TalksContainer>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}

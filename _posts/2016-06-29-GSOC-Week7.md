### Easy Whitelisting of Websites

Currently, to whitelist a website, one has to open the options page, find the website URL and remove it. The URL might be many pages deep inside. It would be easier to whitelist websites right from the context menu.

To make it as intuitive as possible, I decided to disable and enable context menus according to pages. With only **Whitelist Website** option available on blacklisted websites and vice versa. This required me to disable all of the parent menus individually as *Chrome* identifies each menu by a unique ID.

### Build and Commenting

As many features have been implemented and added, they had to be made deployable. I built the latest version of the extension into the `dist` folder. Also, as the final product takes shape, comments and documentation is extremely important to explain what the code does. `jsdocs` automatically creates a documentation from all the comments in the `docs` folder.

### Bug fixing

With the completion of UI before time, I decided to test it thoroughly and look for bugs. I set up use cases and sample tasks and tested for each of them. These tasks were, for example, `add translation pattern, change key, delete pattern, etc.`. As a result I discovered bugs concerning UI breaking and **deleting active translation patterns**

### Bing Translate

Running a week ahead of my proposed timeline, gave me the time to start implementing Bing Translate (Microsoft Translate) ahead of its schedule. This feature implementation involved adding support for MS Translate API :

1. UI changes for two authentication fields
2. Seperating out languages file (which contains all the supported languages)
3. Setting up API calls
4. Adding support in `http.js` for XML requests

### Google Translate

With a day remaining in the week, I started with the last feature proposed before mid-term evaluations - Google Translate support. It presented me with an interesting problem of *multiple promises*.

Google allows a maximum of 128 different strings to be sent in one API call. Since we translate word by word. I have to think of a way to translate a lot of words in API call. This has raised problems with simultaneous API calls, waiting for all promises, maintaining word alignment, etc.

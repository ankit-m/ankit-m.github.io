### Keys Panel and Warning

In the current version, keys are coupled with creation of patterns. There was no way to change the keys of except for selecting the translator in the pattern creation tab. I put the *Translator Keys* panel in the Advanced Tab.

One problem which I faced in this was the binding function. I had plans to use the already existing `updateApiKey()` function in `options.js`. But I it used `this.key` binding dynamic key changing. So I created a new function, which led to a lot of code duplication. It later hit me that all I need to do is to save the keys. So I directly called `this.save` from `ng-blur`.

A lot of users complained about no translations being shown as they hadn'y put in the keys to the corresponding API. To notify the user, we decided to put a warning on the options page. This warning occurs when the user *activates* a pattern which does not have a key.

### Bug hunting

The following bugs were resolved:

1. Empty blacklist caused all websites to be blacklisted
2. Empty blacklist word list causes all words to be blacklisted
3. Some errors generated were not properly caught

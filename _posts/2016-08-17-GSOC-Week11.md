After all features were implemented it was now time to add the final touches to the project made - implementing changes suggested by Bruno, commenting, fixing some errors and making the code ready for deployment. This week's work includes -

1. Fix issue #184 - breaking user defined translations
2. UI fixes - fixing alignment, positioning of buttons and adding links to YouTube channel.
3. Commenting code

### Testing and update to v3.0.0

Before deploying, it was very essential that we test our product thoroughly. I performed all tasks one by one with a variety of combinations to make sure that all the use cases are satisfied. I came across some minor bugs, which were fixed.

After the testing by me, Rohan and Bruno, I updated the `build` to `v3.0.0` marking the end of Google Summer of Code 2016 with OiWorld - Mind the Word.

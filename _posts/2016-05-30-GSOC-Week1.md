title: GSoC Week 1 - OiWorld

### User Interface

The first week of GSoC was all about rebuilding the UI for the Chrome extension - **Mind the Word**. The primary aim was to make it easy for the user to tune the extension to their liking. This involved the following -

1. Complete rebuilding of the of the navigation structure - shifting from tabs to navigation bar
2. Adding panels to categorize various sections and making it easier for the user to find action buttons.
3. Intuitive blacklisting and user defined translations
4. Adding footer for quicker contact and social media.
5. Pagination for long lists
6. Adding color picker for style changes
7. Context dependent UI - Input elements change according to user selection (toggle button, key fields)


The new interface was built in Twitter Bootstrap 3.
